How does a design perspective help in evaluating an investment decision, in obvious ways? Designers are highly tuned in to user needs and natural human behaviors, since this is deeply linked to what they do as designers.  Their insights inform whether an offering truly addresses a human need, and whether the proposed solution has the potential to successfully address those needs.

<li><p><b>How does a design perspective help in evaluating an investment decision, in obvious ways?</b> Designers are highly tuned in to user needs and natural human behaviors, since this is deeply linked to what they do as designers.  Their insights inform whether an offering truly addresses a human need, and whether the proposed solution has the potential to successfully address those needs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>How does a design perspective help in evaluating an investment decision, in non-obvious ways?</b> Design is a manifestation of what a company values, the principles that guide their decisions, and its ability to execute.  Bad design is a reflection of some internal failure within the company.  Read my post <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ux-is-a-canary-in-a-coal-mine-b7764b77f371#.q4os04eil">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Where have you seen a designer&#39;s perspective possibly harmful in the investment process?</b> Just because a company’s offering is not aesthetically pleasing does not mean that it is not a potential investment hit.  Also, an overinvestment in design can sometimes lead to navel-gazing and too much focus on issues that are not really the core problem to solve.</p></li>
<li><p><b>What are three characteristics in a company&#39;s structure/history that will likely lead to success in leveraging design?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Clear vision and mission, sense of purpose, raison d’etre</li>
<li>A strong point of view that guides key decisions for product</li>
<li>Decisive leadership to support #1 and 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>How do you best support CEOs with a purely technical and/or business background to leverage design in their startup?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Help them recruit a great design leader / designer</li>
<li>Point out potential pitfalls with their product if they do not get the design right</li>
<li>Get them close to users to gain insight into their needs and how to best address their needs with their offering</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>What are a few challenges you&#39;ve seen in working with companies that have caught &quot;the design bug&quot; -- especially the CEO?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Naive understanding of what design is</li>
<li>Talks the talk but doesn’t commit to making design a priority (failure to bring in great talent, failure to empower design, etc)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

This little site is something I started at the end of 2015 to learn GitHub Pages but way more importantly, to collect information across designers within the venture capital ecosystem. There's quite a few of them, and I've been fortunate to know many of them. They all have kindly provided key insights into when and how design is making a material impact in the technology ecosystem -- as seen from within venture capital firms.

Designers that participated in this mini-study, in order of getting their answers into me within the wee hours left in 2015:

* [Irene Au](/IreneAu) / Khosla Ventures
* [Elizabeth Weil](/ElizabethWeil) / Andreesen Horowitz

If you are a designer working in the VC space and would like to be added to the list, please drop me a line. It might take me a while to get back to you so please be patient. Placing "DesignAnd.VC: New designer" in the subject line will help me find you. -John Maeda [(designandvc@gmail.com)](mailto:designandvc@gmail.com)

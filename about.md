First of all, [Lisa Katayama](https://twitter.com/tokyomango?lang=en) helped me get this project started, along with [Cliff Kuang](https://twitter.com/cliffkuang) and [Sheel Mohnot](https://twitter.com/pitdesi). Lisa led a brainstorming session on November 18, 2015 in San Francisco to determine what kind of content crossing design and the VC worldcould be gathered. That link [is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1En7qGHHvRgl5od3AWcX3pFMGgcTAXEs01lUsSh4ofOQ/edit?usp=sharing).

I guess I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;fire, ready, aim&rdquo; kind of person, so I decided to see what can get made, and iterate as we go. I asked a few of my colleagues in the venture capital space if they might answer a few standard questions derived from our November brainstorming work, and also from my own personal experience in the VC world at KPCB.

Designers that participated in this mini-study, in order of getting their answers into me within the wee hours left in 2015, are:

* [Irene Au](/IreneAu) / Khosla Ventures
* [Elizabeth Weil](/ElizabethWeil) / Andreesen Horowitz

If you are a designer working in the VC space and would like to be added to the list, please drop me a line. It might take me a while to get back to you so please be patient. Placing &ldquo;DesignAnd.VC: New designer&rdquo; in the subject line will help me find you.

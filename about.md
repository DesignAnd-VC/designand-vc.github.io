[Lisa Katayama](https://twitter.com/tokyomango?lang=en) helped me get this project started, along with [Cliff Kuang](https://twitter.com/cliffkuang) and [Sheel Mohnot](https://twitter.com/pitdesi). Lisa led a brainstorming session for all of us on November 18, 2015 in San Francisco, and we figured out how content for this space could evolve and grow. That link [is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1En7qGHHvRgl5od3AWcX3pFMGgcTAXEs01lUsSh4ofOQ/edit?usp=sharing).

I guess I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;fire, ready, aim&rdquo; kind of person, so I decided to try to ask a few of my colleagues in the venture capital space if they might answer a few standard questions derived from Lisa&rsquo;s work and also from my own personal experience in the VC world.

So this little site is something I started at the end of 2015 to learn GitHub Pages and to gather all the information that came forth from designers within the venture capital ecosystem. There&rsquo;s quite a few of them out there, and I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to know many of them. They all have kindly provided key insights into when and how design is making a material impact in the technology ecosystem -- as seen from within venture capital firms.

Designers that participated in this mini-study, in order of getting their answers into me within the wee hours left in 2015, are:

* [Irene Au](/IreneAu) / Khosla Ventures
* [Elizabeth Weil](/ElizabethWeil) / Andreesen Horowitz

If you are a designer working in the VC space and would like to be added to the list, please drop me a line. It might take me a while to get back to you so please be patient. Placing &ldquo;DesignAnd.VC: New designer&rdquo; in the subject line will help me find you.
